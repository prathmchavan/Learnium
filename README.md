# Next.js Project

## Overview

This is a Next.js project structured with two branches: `main` and `dev`. The `main` branch contains the production-ready code, while the `dev` branch is used for development and testing. 

## Project Structure

- `main`: The production branch. No code should be committed directly to this branch until it has been thoroughly tested in the `dev` branch.
- `dev`: The development branch. All new features, bug fixes, and improvements should be done in this branch.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. Checkout to the `dev` branch for development:

    ```sh
    git checkout dev
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
